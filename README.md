# Animal Facts - React Project

Project objective as described by Codecademy:

Build a program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up.

The program should display a selection of animals on the screen. You may also include a background image. 
Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. 
The selected fact will pop up on the screen. As we keep clicking, weâ€™ll be able to see different facts.
